:arg get_val: a function called with the elapsed time in seconds to obtain the
              current value.  If this function returns ``None``, the
              interpolation will be canceled.  The ``interp_*`` functions in
              this module can be used to construct such functions.
:arg set_val: a function called with the current value to set it.  This may
              also be an ``(obj, attr)`` tuple to do ``obj.attr = val``.  In
              the second form, ``attr`` may be a sequence of attribute names
              corresponding to the sequence of values returned from
              ``get_val`` to set.
:arg t_max: if time becomes larger than this, cancel the interpolation.
:arg bounds: a function that takes the value returned from ``get_val`` and
             checks if it is outside of some boundaries, and returns the
             boundary value ``bdy`` if so (else None).  If the value falls out
             of bounds, ``set_val`` is called with ``bdy`` and the
             interpolation is canceled.
:arg end: used to do some cleanup when the interpolation is canceled (when
          ``get_val`` returns ``None`` or ``t_max``, ``val_min`` or ``val_max``
          comes into effect, but not when the ``rm_timeout`` method is called
          with ``timeout_id``).  This can be a final value to pass to
          ``set_val``, or a function to call without arguments.  If the
          function returns a (non-``None``) value, ``set_val`` is called with
          it.
:arg round_val: whether to round the value(s) (see :func:`interp_round`
                `do_round` argument for details).
:arg multi_arg: whether values should be interpreted as lists of arguments to
                pass to ``set_val`` instead of a single argument.  If
                ``set_val`` is ``(obj, attr)``, it is the same as a
                one-argument function.
:arg resolution: 'framerate' to update the value at.  If not given, the value
                 is set every frame it changes; if given, this sets an upper
                 limit on the number of times per second the value may updated.

                 over the interpolation) also puts an upper limit on the rate.
:arg override: whether to override (abort) previous interpolations with the
               same ``set_val``.  This works for identical functions, and
               ``(obj, attr)`` for the identical objects and the exact same
               sets of attributes (since ``attr`` can be a sequence).  The
               ``end`` action for aborted interpolations is not called.
