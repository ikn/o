o (release 1): a game where you move a window around to get balls where you
want.  Created for a 2-week competition with the theme '80x20 window size'.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x, 3.2 or later 3.x)
Pygame (1.8.1 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)
python-xlib (tested with 0.15rc1)

    RUNNING

This game only works where python-xlib does (meaning you must be using X11).

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or
equivalent or the version of Visual whatever-it's-called that was used to
compile your Python version, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be
available on the system.  Just run

    make

The makefile supports a 'PYTHON_VERSION' argument which can be 2 (default) or
3, which determines which version to build for.

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

For this game to work properly, your window manager/configuration must:
 - support freely movable floating windows
 - update windows as they are moved
 - allow windows to be as small as 30x30
 - let you move windows as small as 30x30
 - leave the central 600x400 area of your screen free

In addition, you may find it useful to disable (if supported and enabled)
window snapping (attraction to/resistance against other windows/screen
borders), if possible.

    PLAYING

To start, move the game's window to the location indicated by the arrow, so
that it contains the yellow rectangle.  To play, move the window around the
screen so that the bouncing ball reaches its goal.  If a ball is destroyed in
any way, you must move the window back to the yellow rectangle to try again.
