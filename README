o is a game where you move a window around to get balls where you want.  I made
it for a 2-week competition with the theme '80x20 window size'.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)
python-xlib (tested with 0.15rc1)

    RUNNING

This game only works where Pygame and python-xlib do (meaning you must be using
X11).  On systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other supported systems, run game.py with your Python 2 executable.

For this game to work properly, your window manager must support floating
windows, allow windows to be as small as 20x20, let you move windows as small
as this, and let any process move windows.

    PLAYING

To play the game, move the window it displays around the screen so that the
bouncing ball(s) reach their goals.  If a ball is destroyed in any way, you
must move the window to the indicated position to try again.
