o (release 1): a game where you move a window around to get balls where you
want.  Created for a 2-week competition with the theme '80x20 window size'.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)
python-xlib (tested with 0.15rc1)

    RUNNING

This game only works where Pygame and python-xlib do (meaning you must be using
X11).  On systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other supported systems, run game.py with your Python 2 executable.

For this game to work properly, your window manager/configuration must:
 - support freely movable floating windows
 - update windows as they are moved
 - allow windows to be as small as 40x40
 - let you move windows as small as 40x40

In addition, you may find it useful to disable (if supported and enabled)
window snapping (attraction to/resistance against other windows/screen
borders), if possible.

    PLAYING

To start, move the game's window to the location indicated by the arrow, so
that it contains the yellow rectangle.  To play, move the window around the
screen so that the bouncing ball reaches its goal.  If a ball is destroyed in
any way, you must move the window back to the yellow rectangle to try again.
